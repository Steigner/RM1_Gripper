## About
RM1 is an experimental robotic platform created to automate antigen testing. This project was developed as part of a master's thesis. The aim was to create a functional and modular prototype that is easily modifiable and deployable after debugging. The basic idea is to create a web-based server that communicates with ROS. ROS was used in the work as a simulation and debugging environment, mainly for robot control. The thesis is divided into four main parts:

+ [<=](https://github.com/Steigner/RM1_server) RM1 - Server
+ [<=](https://github.com/Steigner/RM1_ROS) RM1 - ROS         
+ RM1 - Gripper
+ RM1 - Seg. ANN
